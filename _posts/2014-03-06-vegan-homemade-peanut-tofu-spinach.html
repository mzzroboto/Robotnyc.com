Homemade vegan dumplings with a perfect thin dough are amazing, but making the dough super thin by hand is hard - for me. I opt to buy dumpling skins from the Asian market (without egg) and make my own filling (I found a Korean rice wrapper). This is a super easy meal that can be made almost as fast as frozen dumplings! Play with the ingredients, almost anything tastes good in dumplings (except meat!)<br /><ul><br /><li>1 box of small dumpling skins (without egg - or make your own)</li><br /><li>1 container &nbsp;(14 oz) extra firm organic tofu crumbled</li><br /><li>1 large handful baby spinach (around 2 cups) chopped</li><br /><li>3/4 cup peanuts - blended into a powder</li><br /><li>1/2 red pepper chopped into 1/2" pieces</li><br /><li>2 green onion chopped</li><br /><li>2 TB rice vinegar</li><br /><li>3 TB Braggs Amino (or soy sauce)</li><br /><li>2 TB sesame oil</li></ul><br />Dipping sauces:<br />Sweet &amp; sour sauce, soy sauce, and homemade chili oil<br /><br />Directions: &nbsp;Mix all ingredients into a large bowl. Heat skillet on high and spray lightly with oil. Layout dumpling skins on parchment paper. Have a bowl of water next to you, and place a tablespoon of filling on each dumpling skin. Put some water on your fingertips and stick the two sides of the dumplings together (like a taco). Next make small folds on the top to make the traditional design and to lock in the filling more. Place dumplings in the skillet and fry on both sides for a few minutes until browned. Note: Some people like to add 1/2 cup of water and boil the dumplings at the end, but I find this make them less crunchy - but you can do this at the end if you like. Eat immediately with sweet &amp; sour sauce, soy sauce, and chili oil for dipping.<br /><br />Time: 10 min prep, 10 min frying<br /><br /><em id="__mceDel">Filling will make about 40 dumplings - serves 4</em><br /><br /><iframe src="//instagram.com/p/lNO9RfpAyj/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
